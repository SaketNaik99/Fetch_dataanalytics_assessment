# Fetch_dataanalytics_assessment

The SQLqueries contain solutions to all the database querying questions in the test done on POSTGRESql workspace.<br>
I have created the realational database schema as well.<br>
Finally, I have created a dashboard of some key factors using Python.<br>
I also wanted to mention some inconsistencies that I spotted in the data-<br>
1. Brands table does not seem to have a primary key (we can create a brand id and add it to the receipts_items table) <br>
2. There are a lot of missing values in the data.
3. Some columns are not very useful (processing date, which is mostly empty). These can be dropped from the analysis if no business impact.


Thanks!!
